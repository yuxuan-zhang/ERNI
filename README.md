# ImagingReso

Resonance Imaging

This package provides various flexibilities for plotting expected resonance signal from published online database [National Nuclear Data Center](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/).

By defining the information of sample such as density, effective thickness, one can easily obtain an expected plot of resonance signal of various sample types ()layers of foils, chemical compound

[Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF)](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/exfor/endf00.jsp) is currently supported and more database will be added if needed in future.
